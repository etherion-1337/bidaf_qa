       "'  Address by H.E. Malik Amin Aslam Khan Federal Minister - Climate Change / Advisor to Prime Minister  25th Session of Conference of Parties (COP-25) to the United Nations               Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)                   (11-12 December 2019 Madrid, Spain) Your Excellency, Ms. Carolina Schmidt, President of COP 25 Distinguished Heads of Delegations, Madam Executive Secretary, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen. Madam President, Let me take this opportunity to first congratulate the Government and people of Chile for assuming the presidency of COP-25 and to convey our appreciation to the Government of Spain for their support in hosting the conference in the beautiful city of Madrid. I would also like to acknowledge the efforts put in by the government of Poland in their capacity as Presidency of COP 24 in carrying forward the climate agenda.                                                                       1   Madam President Let us not be under any illusion. The world, as shaped by us, is now on a warpath with nature and we, the political shapers of this situation, are collectively leading the charge brigade. While nature may be resilient, it is no longer silent and an era of consequences is already upon us. The virulent cyclones, rising heat waves, freak floods, melting glaciers and rising sea levels are all vivid and living indicators of not only our failing battle but also of nature’s forceful reply. Madam President, this battle against nature is not a battle that can be won nor a battle that should be won. Instead, a collective retreat is needed to try and take nature on board, to allow it space to bounce back and to tread on a different path of ecologically balanced growth - before we hit the thresholds of climate irreversibility. The politics of climate change, played out in these hallowed halls, unfortunately remains totally out of sync with the scientific evidence and the physical reality of climate change. If this continues, all of us may be soon destined to the dustbins of history – a history of self inflicted destruction.                                                                      2   Our youth is out on the streets and sees the urgency and emergency, our scientists not only see it but have already predicted the abyss facing us and our economies are already draining under the burden of forced adaptation costs. So Madam President, let us negotiate to act and not to further delay action. Within the comity of nations, Pakistan solidly supports the Paris Consensus and at same time it faces a climate challenge which is not only unique but equally inescapable. We contribute less than 1% of the global greenhouse gas emissions but yet, every year, we keep on climbing up the ladder of climate vulnerability. The long term German Watch index, places Pakistan at 5th position in terms of climate vulnerability and 3rd in terms of the economic costs borne over this period – estimated at $3.2 bn. Within this ranking, we also join a small and unique group of countries which is, consistently and simultaneously, appearing on not only the yearly but also the long term climate vulnerability index. This, Madam President, is not an enviable position to be in, and certainly not a position of our own making nor of our own choosing,                                                                     3   as it places Pakistan squarely on the front lines of an unfolding disaster. Climate change, as viewed from Pakistan’s lens, may well be the biggest human rights violation of history where the lives and livelihoods of billions of people has been put at risk – all due to the unbridled pollution and uncontrolled excesses of a few. Pakistan does not have an option to escape climate change and its impacts. The forced climate adaptation needs remain at between $7 to $14 billion per annum, thus making climate compatible development an inevitable direction to take and building resilience of our vulnerable communities as well as our infrastructure, an undeniable option While facing this daunting challenge, Pakistan remains equally committed to raising its ambition for climate action and lead the response in shaping a new future. A future at balance and harmony with nature and a future which can further the dreams of our youth and avoid hopelessly crushing them at the altar of an impending climate catastrophe, Madam President - this future is possible.                                                                       4   We, in Pakistan, have chosen to position ourselves to tread on a sustainable development pathway, in line with the spirit of the Paris Agreement. A paradigm shift in our business as usual is at play which involves enormous political and economic cost. Led by our Prime Minister Imran Khan’s green vision and backed with concerted action, Pakistan has been making a shift towards a “clean and green” Pakistan. We shifted away from having the highest deforestation rate in Asia, by successfully planting a billion trees in KhybetPakhtunkhwa province in 4 years and increasing the provincial forest cover by 6.3%. We have now raised the bar by initiating the 10 billion tree tsunami - across the whole country. This project is helping us to generate thousands of green jobs, revive the forest biodiversity, engage the indigenous communities and energize our youth to become custodians of a green future for our nation. Secondly, we have decided to shift away from polluting transport by framing our first electric vehicle policy which is now targeting a 30% shift to electric by 2030. Earlier this month, the city of Karachi in Pakistan launched the world’s first “zero emissions” metro line – which incidentally is also the first transport project to be financed under the Green Climate fund.                                                                      5   Thirdly, a “Clean-Green cities index” has been initiated in 20 cities to trigger a shift towards improved waste management and sanitation. Concurrently, Pakistan has decided to get out of its plastic addiction by banning the single use plastic bags – which is now being enforced across the country. Fourthly, our “Recharge Pakistan” initiative is focused on shifting our direction by effectively managing and prudently utilizing our water resources – turning catastrophic floods into an opportunity for recharging aquifers and naturally restoring ecosystems. This is an innovative initiative and an eco-system-based adaptation to climate change. Concurrently, to fulfil our growing energy needs, we are making a purposeful transition towards renewable energy by harnessing the untapped potential of wind, solar and hydro in Pakistan and are targeting a huge 60% shift towards clean “carbon free” energy by 2030. In compliance with its responsibilities, Pakistan’s second national communications was recently submitted, the national committee on carbon markets has been set up to explore market based instruments and our NDC is being updated into an “enhanced                                                                     6   NDC” to incorporate all the country-financed activities practically underway in Pakistan and reflected in our 5 point environmental agenda. Also, Pakistan is now launching the “Eco-System Restoration Fund” as an independent, transparent and comprehensive financial mechanism which shall facilitate Pakistan’s transition towards climate compatible development through targeted initiatives on afforestation, biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration. All using nature based solutions to address nature based challenges. This platform will allow partners to share with Pakistan the dream of a better, low carbon and ecologically balanced future. Finally, Madam President While countries like Pakistan are willing to think out of the box as well as act out of the box, we urge that raising ambition is essentially seen in the context of specific national circumstances and development imperatives of developing countries as well as the unfulfilled commitments with regard to mitigation, technology transfer and provision of climate finance, all of which need to be met urgently and to be scaled up significantly.                                                                    7   Pakistan remains committed and ready to play its part in what has to be a coordinated effort based on a relationship of trust and a partnership with nature. We have to ACT NOW because Madam President our collective INACTION will neither be forgiven nor forgotten. I thank you.                                                                 8 '"

       "  'Thank you, Chair,\\nI have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union and its Member States. The following\\ncountries align themselves with this statement: Turkey§, The Republic of North Macedonia\\uf02a,\\nMontenegro*, Iceland+, Serbia*, Albania*, Bosnia and Herzegovina*, Norway+, Ukraine, The\\nRepublic of Moldova and Armenia.\\nChair, allow me first to congratulate you on your election to this important post, and to thank\\nDirector Di Pippo and the Office for Outer Space Affairs, for the excellent preparation of this\\nsession.\\nChair, the EU, its Member States and the European Space Agency together have developed strong\\nand unique space capacities and industry in Europe. The EU has a large budget for space, most of\\nwhich is dedicated to the European Global Navigation Satellite systems, Galileo and EGNOS, and\\nthe European earth-observation system, Copernicus. Also space research and innovation are\\ncurrently supported by the EU Horizon 2020 programme, which will support the competitiveness\\nof the European space sector and help tackle societal challenges, and is open to international\\ncooperation. An important reason for this investment effort is that we believe that space science,\\napplications and technologies have a great potential to help to tackle major global challenges such\\nas climate change, disaster management, food security, environmental protection, efficient\\nmanagement of resources, transport development, marine protection and maritime awareness,\\nmigration and protection of cultural heritage.\\nIn this respect, we are looking forward to continue our work on the 2030 Space Agenda and its\\nimplementation plan with a view to enhancing global space governance and mobilising space for\\nthe realisation of the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals and targets, the Paris\\nAgreement as well as the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. We see the need for\\nenhanced capacity-building activities in this regard.\\nChair, the EU space flagship programmes Galileo/EGNOS and Copernicus have made impressive\\nprogress during the last years. They are an illustration of pan-European and international\\ncooperation because they are funded and owned by the EU and overseen by the European\\nCommission, whereas deployment, design, and further development of the systems and\\ninfrastructure are entrusted to the European Space Agency to which also non-European countries',\n",
       "  'Candidate Country\\nCandidate Countries The Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Albania as well as potential Candidate Country\\nBosnia and Herzegovina continue to be part of the Stabilisation and Association Process.\\n+\\nIceland and Norway are members of the EFTA and of the European Economic Area.\\n\\uf02a',\n",
       "  '\\x0care associated. Moreover, these programmes are under civilian control and their data can be used\\nworldwide and free of charge for a broad range of applications.\\nChair, Galileo is autonomous but also interoperable with existing satellite navigation systems.\\nFour more Galileo satellites have been launched in July last year, bringing the constellation to 26\\nsatellites, and the completed constellation will include 30 satellites. When Galileo is fully\\noperational in 2020, it will allow improved services and provide new business opportunities in a\\nwide variety of applications in many sectors of the economy worldwide.\\nToday, around 7% of the EU economy is dependent on global navigation satellite signals. This\\nincludes transport, logistics, telecommunications and energy sectors. The EU wishes to strengthen\\nthe competitiveness of its industry and considers space as a source of industrial excellence and\\ntechnological development with several potential spill-over effects into other sectors. Independent\\nstudies show that Galileo will deliver around EUR 90 billion to the EU economy over the first 20\\nyears of operations. This includes direct revenues for the space and applications industries, and\\nindirect benefits for society such as more effective transport systems or more effective rescue\\noperations.\\nCopernicus is a user-driven European Earth observation and monitoring programme. In 2018,\\nwhich unfortunately saw natural disasters in many countries, Copernicus has again shown its\\nexceptional usefulness by providing accurate maps that allow for a rapid assessment of the\\ndamage and planning of rescue operations.\\nChair, the EU is strengthening its strategic autonomy and increasing global cooperation on space,\\nin particular through Galileo and Copernicus and our space programmes also contribute to our\\nforeign policy, helping us take better informed and swifter decisions.\\nChair, the EU supports the continuous discussions of guidelines, space norms and regulations at\\nthe United Nations. We reiterate that the United Nations Charter, UN Treaties on outer space and\\nfive UNGA sets of principles, as well as other related documents and resolutions adopted by the\\nUNGA, constitute the cornerstone of international space law. As a responsible space actor, the EU\\nis exploring the possibility for its accession to the relevant UN Treaties on Outer Space.\\nWe also reiterate that UNOOSA, COPUOS and its Subcommittees are unique international\\nplatforms for international cooperation in space, including on the development of international\\nnorms and standards regulating space activities. We think that COPUOS as a multilateral forum is\\nessential for developing norms for enhancing the safety and sustainability of activities in outer\\nspace. In this respect:\\n\\uf0b7 We welcome the agreement on 21 guidelines for Long Term Sustainability of Outer Space\\nActivities by the Working Group on the Long Term Sustainability of Outer Space. We\\nencourage all members to report on their national implementation.\\n\\uf0b7 We also support a continued dialogue in COPUOS to better understand the concept of\\nSpace Traffic Management as well as the related guidelines, practices, standards or norms\\nof behaviour, in particular for the safe and sustainable use of outer space.\\n\\uf0b7 We equally support the development of an international framework for the exploration,\\nexploitation and utilisation of space resources within COPUOS.\\n\\uf0b7 We acknowledge, in particular, the Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines of the COPUOS as\\nthe pertinent international standard of conduct in this field in ensuring the safety and\\nsustainability of space activities. New technologies of Space Surveillance and Tracking\\ncould play an important role in ensuring the sustainable use of space.',\n",
       "  '\\x0cChair, we underline the need to foster increased international cooperation, and to establish\\nprinciples of responsible behaviour, and sustainability of space activities. Furthermore, we stress\\nthe need to strengthen commitments to avoid potentially harmful interference with the peaceful\\nexploration and use of outer space, to facilitate equitable access to outer space, and to increase\\ntransparency of outer space activities.\\nThis would contribute to responsible behaviour and constitute a transparency and confidence\\nbuilding measure in outer space by creating, for example, procedures for notification of\\noperations, such as scheduled manoeuvres, that could pose a risk to life or property on the ground\\nor to the safety of flight of the space objects of other States.\\nWe also support a political commitment not to undertake activities detrimental to the safety,\\nsecurity and sustainability of outer-space activities, such as intentional destructions of space\\nobjects that would generate long lived debris.\\nAgainst this background, we underline the achievements on the Long Term Sustainability\\nGuidelines as well as the importance of continuing an appropriate process within COPUOS\\nregarding the safe and sustainable use of outer space.\\nFinally Chair, we believe that there would be value in agreeing a non-legally binding instrument,\\npotentially to be negotiated within the framework of the UN, as a way to deliver these objectives.\\nThis instrument would take care not to duplicate the work by COPUOS as the UN’s mandated\\nnorm creating body for the peaceful use of outer space and to respect its role in the further\\ndevelopment of the legal regime governing space activities. Such a voluntary instrument would\\nbuild upon the COPUOS achievements on the Long Term Sustainability Guidelines and would be\\ncomplementary to these Guidelines.\\nThank you Chair\\n__________________________']}"
